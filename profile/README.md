# Digital Work Lab

The **Digital Work Lab** is dedicated to advancing research and teaching in the fields of **digital work, open collaboration, and digital education**. Our mission is to foster impactful, rigorous, and open research that addresses the challenges of the digital workplace, while also equipping students and practitioners with the knowledge and tools to succeed in a rapidly evolving digital world.

We maintain a **public handbook** that organizes our procedures, documents, and files, and serves as a key resource for contributors and collaborators.
